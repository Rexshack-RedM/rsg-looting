# rsg-looting

Secure NPC looting and player robbery for **RSG Framework (RedM)**, with ox_lib notifications, multi-language support and Discord webhook logging.

---

## Features

### NPC Looting
- Loot dead NPCs using the native RDR2 loot prompt (hold the loot key).
- Random reward on every body: **common** or **rare** item plus a small amount of cash.
- Configurable rare chance, item pools and cash ranges.
- Optional lawman alert (via `rsg-lawman`) when a body is looted.
- Increases the player's outlaw status on successful loot / robbery (configurable).

### Player Robbery
- Rob a nearby player who is **dead**, **handcuffed** or has their **hands up**.
- Takes the victim's cash and/or blood money (toggle each) and opens their inventory.
- Progress bar with animation; can be cancelled.
- Per-victim cooldown so the same player can't be robbed repeatedly.

### Security
- All rewards are decided and given **server side**; the client never chooses items or amounts.
- Server validates every loot: the entity exists, is an NPC, is dead, is within range and hasn't already been looted.
- Per-player loot cooldown stops event spamming.
- Robbery is checked by server-side distance, victim state and cooldown. The hands-up check asks the **victim's** client, so the robber can't fake it.
- Inventory space is checked before items are added.

### Discord Webhooks
- Three separate channels: **loot**, **rob** and **exploit** (rejected / suspicious requests).
- Rich embeds with character name, citizen ID, player name, license, Discord mention and coordinates.
- Built-in send queue that respects Discord rate limits (retries on HTTP 429).
- Webhook URLs are kept in a **server-only** file so players can't read them.

### Localisation
- All player-facing and webhook text uses ox_lib locales.
- Included languages: `en`, `de`, `el`, `es`, `fr`, `ja`, `nl`, `pl`, `pt-br`, `ro`.

   setr ox:locale en
   ```
5. Add the items you want to use to `Config.CommonItems` / `Config.RareItems` (they must exist in `rsg-core/shared/items.lua`).

## Usage

### Looting NPCs
1. Kill an NPC.
2. Walk up to the body and **hold the loot key** (default RDR2 loot prompt).
3. When the loot animation finishes, the server gives you a random item and some cash.

Each body can only be rewarded once.

### Robbing Players
Robbery is started with the client event:

```lua
TriggerEvent('rsg-looting:client:RobPlayer')
```

Hook this into your radial menu, target system or a command, for example:

```lua
RegisterCommand('rob', function()
    TriggerEvent('rsg-looting:client:RobPlayer')
end, false)
```

The target must be within `Config.RobDistance` and be **dead**, **handcuffed** or have their **hands up** (`script_proc@robberies@homestead@lonnies_shack@deception` / `hands_up_loop`). If your hands-up script uses a different animation, update `HANDSUP_DICT` / `HANDSUP_ANIM` at the top of `client/client.lua`.

### Sending Custom Webhooks (other resources)

```lua
exports['rsg-looting']:SendWebhook('loot', {
    title = 'Custom Log',
    description = 'Something happened',
    color = 0xFFFFFF,
})
```

Channel must be `loot`, `rob` or `exploit`.

## Adding a Language

1. Copy `locales/en.json` to `locales/<code>.json` (e.g. `it.json`).
2. Translate the values. Keep every `%s` placeholder.
3. Set `setr ox:locale <code>` in your `server.cfg`.
